# Abstract
For this meetup we are excited to be partnering with the San Francisco Redis Meetup to bring you a night of great talks! We'll be joined by Elizabeth K. Joseph, Developer Advocate at Mesosphere who'll discuss service discovery on DC/OS. We'll also be joined by Tague Griffith, head of Developer Advocacy at Redis Labs who will talk about building and deploying microservices with Redis on DC/OS.
## Elizabeth K. Joseph - Service Discovery on DC/OS:
Service discovery in DC/OS allows you to connect to your applications without having to know where they are running. This is particularly valuable when you have an application fail and it is restarted on a different host. We will explore the two mechanisms of that DC/OS provides, Mesos-DNS and Named virtual IPs.
## Tague Griffith - Building and Deploying Microservices with Redis on DC/OS:
The selection of a proper cache and data store is essential to delivering a highly performant Microservices architecture. Redis is a popular choice among developers for providing caching and storage services for microservices. This talk will look at deployment options for Redis within a microservices environment and some of the concerns deploying data stores in production.
